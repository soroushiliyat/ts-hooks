# 🧠 React Hooks Practice – TypeScript Edition

A modular React project built with **TypeScript**, focused on practicing and mastering core React hooks in isolation.  
Each hook is implemented in its own component to demonstrate real-world usage, edge cases, and clean patterns.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- ⚛️ **React** – Functional components and hooks
- 🧩 **TypeScript** – Type-safe development
- ⚡ **Vite** – Fast bundling and dev server
- 🎨 **CSS Modules** – Scoped styling
- ☁️ **Vercel** – Continuous deployment from GitHub

---

## 📁 Hook Modules

Each hook is implemented in a dedicated component:

- `UseStateComponents.tsx` – State management with `useState`
- `UseEffectComponents.tsx` – Side effects and lifecycle with `useEffect`
- `UseRefComponents.tsx` – DOM refs and persistent values with `useRef`
- `UseReducerComponents.tsx` – Complex state logic with `useReducer`
- `UseContextComponents.tsx` – Global context sharing with `useContext`
- `CustomHookComponents.tsx` – Reusable logic with custom hooks
